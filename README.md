## Selected Data Science Book: Disruptive Possibilities: How Big Data Changes Everything
**Author:** Jeffrey Needham  
**Institution/Publisher:** O'Reilly Media  
**URL:** https://www.amazon.com/Disruptive-Possibilities-Data-Changes-Everything-ebook/dp/B00CLH387W

**Why I'm Interested:** This book explores the transformative potential of big data technology and its impact across industries and government agencies. As someone studying Big Data Analytics, I'm particularly interested in understanding how big data provides unprecedented visibility into operational efficiency and changes traditional approaches to problem-solving. The book's focus on the evolution from conventional computing to Hadoop analytics clouds aligns perfectly with our coursework, and its practical perspective on how big data disrupts established business models will help me better understand the real-world applications of the techniques we're learning in class.
